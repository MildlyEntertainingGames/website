<meta name="description" content="We managed to do another game jam! After a long break we decided to participate in Ludum Dare 55. The theme was &amp;ldquo;Summoning&amp;rdquo; and we created a microgame collection called Jimmy&amp;rsquo;s Wish. The game follows Jimmy, a lonely boy who finds a book on summoning rituals. He attempts various bizarre rituals to summon a friend, with the steps of each ritual represented as a microgame. Working within the three-day time limit of the jam was, as always, challenging but rewarding. We had to prioritize and compromise constantly to achieve something that is at least a completely playable game. This resulted in something that resembles something finished in some places more than others. While we couldn&amp;rsquo;t implement everything we wanted, especially the result of the summmoning, we think the game still captures the &amp;ldquo;Summoning&amp;rdquo; theme well (I mean it&amp;rsquo;s what you are doing). We&amp;rsquo;re already planning to continue working on it and at least finish our original plans. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t played &amp;ldquo;Jimmy&amp;rsquo;s Wish&amp;rdquo; yet, we recommend giving it a try. Experience the unsettling world of occult rituals and microgames, and witness Jimmy&amp;rsquo;s descent into loneliness as he seeks companionship.
